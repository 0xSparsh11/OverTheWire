## Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

# cmds: ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

> To navigate to readme
- after connecting to overthewire lab
- 'ls' command- lists all the files in the pwd.
- We find readme, to see the contents present in readme we use 'cat' command
- We get the password we are looking for.
