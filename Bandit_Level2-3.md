## Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

- So in general the linux consider "command [options] argument1 argument2". In here, the arguments are separated by spaces. If we try to use filenames with spaces directly, it will be treated as separate arguments rather than just one argument.
- Now the solution is put the file name between "file name" or use the black slash as shown in the below figure

- And we use double quote "file name" & get the password for next level.
